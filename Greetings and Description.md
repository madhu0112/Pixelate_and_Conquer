We are a team from GSSS Institute of Engineering and Technology for Women.
And we are happy to have gained this opportunity to participate and learn.
Initially, we thought of modeling a different kind of game. But due to lack of resources from our side, we couldn't complete it.
So, we decided to design a simple game instead.
This game, 
"Kurukshethra"
Has simple features like arrow hitting, scoring, time limit, star system

Arjuna and Duryodhana are the characters, where obviously, arjuna is the one shooting the arrow.
level system is included for after the certain score (60 and incrementation of 20 for the next multiples of sixty)
for star system, scores will be 15 for first star, 30 for the next and 50 for the third star to be filled
each level has time limits of  minutes

Thank you
